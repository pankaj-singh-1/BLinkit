1️⃣ Customers prefer "Low Fat" products over "Regular".

2️⃣ The most purchased items are "Fruits and Veggies" followed by "Snack Foods", indicating that we should stock up more on these items to attract more customers. 

3️⃣ Medium-sized outlets are driving more sales than larger outlets. 
 
4️⃣ Surprisingly, Tier 3 cities are generating more revenue than Tier 1 cities. Opening more stores in Tier 3 cities could help us maximize future sales. 

5️⃣ Outlets established in 2018 are showing higher sales, so we should analyze these locations to attract even more customers. 

6️⃣ "Supermarket Type 1" outlets, with more items available for sale, are driving more sales. This shows a direct relation between the number of items available and customer purchases. Replicating this strategy across other outlets could boost sales.
